## Install && Run

### Prerequisite

* `yarn` (recommended) or `npm`
* `python 3.6.0` and `virtualenv`
    * Note: you can use `pyenv` to manage your different versions of python
* `postgresql` (or other database that you want)

Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#linux-tab) follows official documentation.

Install [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv) follows official documentation.


### Install project dependencies

Go to project root directory:

~~~bash
yarn
yarn global add gulp
~~~

If you meet permission problem for global install, check [this](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/1060#issuecomment-268160528) out.


### Set up python virtual environment

If you don't have python 3.6.0 installed, you can choose to use [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv)

```bash
brew install pyenv
pyenv install 3.6.0
pyenv local 3.6.0
```

After that, create a virtual python environment using python 3.6.0, naming the folder as `pyenv` which has been added to `.gitignore`

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv -p python3 pyenv
```

Source your virtualenv and install the required package through pip

```bash
source pyenv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```


### Customize your django setting

```bash
vim backend/project_name/settings.py
```

You probably want to change:

1. Database Config
2. Timezone
3. Cache Method
4. Others

(if you are using `postgresql`, then create a user called `django` with `django` database, and the default setting is good to go, otherwise you may need to install database driver for your own database)


### Run gulp with webpack to generate bundle assets

**On development (with react-hot-reload):**

```bash
gulp
```

**On production (with uglify-js and other optimazitions):**

```bash
gulp --env production
```


### Run django backend server

```bash
cd backend
```

**On development:**

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

**On production:**

```bash
vim project_name/settings.py
```

Set `DEBUG` to `False`

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic
# Setup Apache or Nginx to support static files here
python manage.py runserver
```
